As a leader you must always be looking forward for the sake of your
team. When you face a problem and don�t know what steps need to
be taken to advance the team, ask the following questions:
Why do we have this problem?
How do we solve this problem?
What specific steps must we take to solve this problem?

inertia
I'm sharing the issues and concerns as my team got affected.is it not the right questions to ask
�I don�t know� and �I need your help.�
guidance and advice and need wise counsel and insightful answers


�I am only a little child and do not know how to carry
out my duties.�

either �I am not enough� or �I don�t have enough.�

I'm open because I want my team members to be open.

I value them and want to add value.To do that, I believe I must get to know them. That requires that I ask
questions, they talk, and I listen.

I am a strong believer in the power of ideas and of shared thinking. Any idea
gets better when the right people get a chance to add to it and improve it. And
good ideas can become great ones when people work together to improve them.


how to ask.

When I was a young leader, I didn�t feel wise enough,
strong enough, mature enough, competent enough, confident enough, or
qualified enough. When I began to be honest with myself, allow my weaknesses
to humble me, and go to God for help, I began to change. I became more open
and authentic. I was willing to admit my mistakes and weaknesses. I developed
appropriate humility, and I began to change and grow.

My journey at that time was difficult and often lonely. I had to drop many
bad habits. I had to change wrong priorities. I had to embrace new ways of
thinking. I had to ask myself hard questions. Before, I had been unwilling to be
wrong, and as a result I had been unable to discover what was right. Isn�t it
strange how we must surrender being right in order to find what�s right, how
humility enables us to be authentic, vulnerable, trustworthy, and intimate with
others? 

huddles - I do this because I want to make the
most of the time I have, but I also do it to engage with the other person

There is something
about a well-worded question that often penetrates to the heart of the matter and
triggers new ideas and insights.�

successful leaders shared
their best practices with others who had the chance to ask questions.

 share their fresh ideas with more experienced
leaders, who gave them feedback.

It was a place where ideas were being reshaped into even better
ideas

Understand the value of questions
Desire the success of others
Add value to others� thoughts
Are not threatened by others� strengths
Can emotionally handle quick changes in the conversation
Understand their place of value at the table
Bring out the best thinking in the people around them
Have experienced success in the area under discussion
Leave the table with a �we� attitude, not a �me� attitude

Too often, as leaders, we get fixated on our own point of view and spend our
time trying to convince others of our opinions instead of trying to find out theirs.

Before you attempt to set things right, make
sure you see things right.

most
miscommunication is a result of people�s having different assumptions


We can
correct those wrong assumptions and prevent miscommunication by asking
questions.


What is the main thing you would change in your team?

Good
thinkers solve problems, they never lack ideas that can build an organization,


�What luck for rulers that men do not think. - we need to develop the process of
good thinking

Thinking is hard work; that�s why so few
do it.

The future belongs to the
curious. The ones who are not afraid to try it, explore it, poke at it, question it,
and turn it inside out

if you
want to make progress and find new ways of thinking and doing, you need to ask
questions.

good people skills and definitely add value to the team


What is your passion? What have you achieved? What have you done
uncommonly well? How are you wired? Where do you belong?
