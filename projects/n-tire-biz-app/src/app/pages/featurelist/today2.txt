few are like militant variety�crusaders who are true believers in a cause. Although these leaders usually have the interests of the organization at heart, their approach to
advocacy often torpedoes their own career. When these employees jump on their

she could handle a difficult situation in a positive manner

Every morning, you start the day with a fresh supply of energy. By the end of the
day, you will have spent that energy allowance on something. You can choose to
focus your energy in ways that will increase your leverage and help you reach
your goals�or not.

Sociopaths
devote their efforts exclusively to fulfilling selfish desires, while Martyrs
exhaust themselves by endlessly striving to meet the needs of others or
vigorously championing a cause in the face of constant opposition. Dimwits,
who tend to be controlled by their emotions, burn up a great deal of energy
satisfying unconscious psychological drives. Chuck probably would fall into this
category. Winners, like Vivian and Mario, demonstrate Political Intelligence by
refusing to be held hostage by their feelings. Instead, they concentrate on their
goals and take actions that will advance both personal and organizational interests.

even if you feel cheated, overlooked, or unappreciated, try
to keep your negative emotional reactions to yourself. When you have concerns,
strive to address them in a calm and professional manner. Dumping all your true
feelings on people is a guaranteed leverage killer. (Anyone who believes that
complete emotional honesty is a virtue definitely lacks Political Intelligence.)

The Power of Results:
Delivering results that make your organization more
competitive, effective, or efficient

The Power of Knowledge: 
Developing impressive expertise in your work�will cause people to view you as a source of
information and a valuable resource.

The Power of Attitude:
consistently friendly, helpful, and cooperative. 

The Power of Empathy: Most people appreciate a sympathetic ear. As an
organizational psychologist, I often find that clients benefit from simply being
able to talk about work issues with someone who feels safe. Not that you should
strive to become the Dear Abby of your department�that would be
counterproductive�but genuinely trying to understand and appreciate others�
problems shows that you are not solely concerned with yourself. Beverly, a
human resources specialist, was widely known as the person to see if you were
having issues with your manager or, as a manager, if you had issues with
employees. She was always willing to listen and help people figure out what to
do. As a fringe benefit, Beverly gained a great deal of information about what
was going on in the company�and that, too, can increase leverage. Of course,
you do have to keep any confidences to yourself. 


Sharing secrets is one way to
ensure that eventually no one will trust you.


The Power of Networks: Political Intelligence involves building positive
relationships�so it logically follows that Winners increase their leverage by
maintaining helpful connections with as many people as possible. Your network
is simply the sum total of all the people you can call on for information,
assistance, or advice�and this �relationship power� is available to everyone in
unlimited supply. The more connections you have�both inside and outside your
organization�the greater your ability to get things done and therefore the higher
your leverage. As an added bonus, if you ever decide that your best political
strategy is to exit for a better situation, your external network will improve the
odds of your finding a desirable job elsewhere.


The Power of Inclusion: Involving others in your decisions, activities, and
projects can increase support and produce better outcomes

The Power of Detachment: Although feeling passionate about your job is a
plus, too much passion can be dysfunctional. Dedication to your work may make
you credible and persuasive, but those who are too emotionally invested in their
jobs can become defensive and inflexible. People who overreact to critiques or
constructive suggestions tend to be difficult to work with, so the ability to
disengage emotions and view issues objectively can increase your influence.
When you develop a reputation as an unbiased and thoughtful observer, others
are more likely to seek you out for consultation. As more people consult you,
your leverage will increase.


 your good fortune depends upon both what you do and
who you know�or more accurately, who knows you. Doing a sorry job will
eventually damage your reputation, regardless of your personal popularity. On
the other hand, producing absolutely brilliant work will get you nowhere unless
the right people know about it.

Positive relationships build political capital.

Allies provide you with information, advice, assistance, and support. They are
your most valuable political asset.


Because
Partners are potentially powerful allies, they should always be cultivated, never
alienated. Should you happen to have a naturally competitive temperament, you
need to turn it off if you�re working with someone on a common project or
trying to accomplish a shared goal. Partners should focus their competitive
instincts on exceeding expectations, improving past performance, or outdoing
the company�s rivals�not on beating each other. When that happens, everyone
loses.

 Highly
task-driven people often see interpersonal interaction as an unnecessary
distraction from their �real� work. What they fail to realize is that some of those
distracting relationships might actually help them produce better results.

Without an established
relationship, people quickly start blaming and faultfinding, thereby reducing
both the likelihood of solving the immediate problem and the odds of any
positive communication in the future.


Identify the people you need to know. The most important allies are
those who can help you achieve your goals.

Try to attract people, not repel them
competent, helpful, friendly, cheerful, interesting, pleasant, 

� Strive for predictability:
when she�s up, she�s cheerful and fun and exciting and
friendly�but when she�s down, she�s dissatisfied and depressed and
angry.

enjoys heated emotional debates

Winners know better than to get thrown off
track by difficult people. They just learn how to deal with them.


All behavior has a purpose.

The nagging micromanager may
be comforted by a feeling of control, even though his frequent interference
causes many employees to quit. 
The procrastinator who puts off difficult
decisions may be reducing her anxiety, even though the delays inevitably create
future problems.

Categorized by motive, focused, emotional,or vengeful. Focused adversaries simply want to get their own way and view
you as an obstacle.

she was clearly trying to make herself look good by making
them look bad, 


these ambitious fanatics become Sociopaths, who will happily stomp
over anyone to advance their careers.

Emotional adversaries are a completely different breed. These poor souls are
truly out of control, driven by their intense emotional needs. Underlying their
dysfunctional behavior is a deep-seated anger or anxiety that frequently
overrides the more logical portion of their brain. One sure sign of an emotional
adversary is that the person creates problems for everyone, not just for you.
Charlene, the head of a nonprofit organization, was being driven to distraction
by her new assistant, Erica. On two occasions, Erica had gotten into shouting
matches with another secretary, whom she accused of gossiping about her
behind her back. She also refused to interact with anyone from the finance
department because they had failed to include her in a birthday luncheon. While
leading a group discussion, she began pounding on the table and yelling when
she thought people had stopped listening to her. Charlene can coach and counsel
Erica till her lips turn blue, but I guarantee that it will make no difference at all:
Erica is completely in the grip of her emotions and is unlikely to change without
the help of therapy or medication or both.

 Some play �poor little me,�
presenting themselves as insecure, vulnerable, and helpless. One such pitiful
woman managed to talk her boss out of $1,500 before he realized that she was
borrowing money from half the men in the department and never paying it back.


These sneaky characters specialize in pointed
remarks, subtle challenges, cold shoulders, and disparaging comments. With
some, you find yourself feeling uneasy whenever they�re around. But with
others, you may never even identify them as an adversary until someone else
tells you. Or you suddenly find yourself unemployed.


Stealth opponents are vicious. A close encounter with one can make you feel
justifiably paranoid for quite a while. If you get wind of their underhanded
activities, you can initiate damage control by confronting them directly and
taking steps to protect your reputation. Unfortunately, victims often recognize
these co-workers as adversaries only after the damage is already done�and
sometimes they never learn about them at all.


As you walk through this world, you will encounter
people with a wide variety of temperaments, personalities, habits, and work
styles.
That some of them are going to irritate you is a 100 percent certainty.

If you let them push your emotional buttons, you will
find yourself entangled in unnecessary and distracting conflicts. But if you stay
focused on your goals and keep your logical brain cells working, you can
manage the situation to your advantage.

�she�s simply a difficult person

their actions can easily lure you into an ongoing power struggle.
You need to resist this temptation. 

A battle for control will just make you seem
uncooperative, make others uncomfortable, and make your adversary angry,
inviting retaliation.

Once a power struggle is under way, someone is probably
going to lose. 


At work, we generally expect people to act like adults, but emotional
adversaries seem more like kids: they throw tantrums, pout, form cliques, play
power games, seek attention, or get their feelings hurt. This immature behavior
is not limited to a particular person or situation. 


The greatest risk with emotional adversaries is that they can �hook� into your
own emotional vulnerabilities, causing you to do things that are politically
stupid. Nabil, a sales representative, fell into this trap. Nabil was quite successful
until he found himself working for Walter, a manager who had the reputation of
being suspicious, defensive, and sometimes downright insulting. But at least
Walter was an equal-opportunity Dimwit�he was nasty to everyone who
worked for him, so most people just put up with his abuse until they could
transfer to another district. However, he was a bad match for Nabil, who was a
highly anxious person underneath his confident sales-guy facade. When Walter
began to criticize everything from Nabil�s interpersonal skills to his travel
schedule, Nabil went into a tizzy. He took communication classes, signed up for
a time management workshop, consulted a personal coach, and even began
seeing a therapist. He was spending so much time and energy trying to �fix
himself� for Walter that he failed to meet his sales goals, making the situation
worse. Walter�s criticism had hooked into Nabil�s personal anxieties, yanking
him out of his usual adult state and triggering a childlike response. Walter�s
long-standing reputation as a highly critical manager should have been a signal
to Nabil to temper his reaction. All those self-improvement solutions are a total
waste of energy, because Nabil is not the problem here�Walter is. Nothing that
Nabil does will make any difference whatsoever

Forget about changing their
personalities�that would probably require psychiatric or chemical intervention.
You simply want to reduce their disruptive behavior, particularly around you.
Here�s the key: you must control your own reactions, because an emotional
response is exactly the reward that this adversary is seeking (albeit sometimes
unconsciously). Maintain a calm, rational, adult demeanor, at all times. When an
angry outburst produces no reaction, the person will eventually calm down.
When a challenging remark is met with a question instead of a comeback, the
person will usually stop arguing. When tears fail to elicit sympathy, they will
soon dry up. There is one exception to this rule: if adversaries are truly
disturbed, with absolutely no control over their behavior, then nothing you do
will make any difference. The only solution is to stay out of their way.


(1) Accept the fact that Walter is a Dimwit and
stop expending energy on useless change strategies. 
(2) Focus on meeting or
exceeding sales goals. Outstanding performance will give Nabil the leverage he
needs to counteract any negative reviews from Walter. 
(3) Strengthen his
network of allies, capitalizing on any opportunities to make a positive
impression on upper management. 
(4) Stay calm and focused when talking with
Walter, no matter what he says. 
(5) Be available when needed, but otherwise
stay out of Walter�s way. No point volunteering to be a target.

Responding to emotional adversaries can really test your self-control. During
every interaction, you must focus like a laser on your immediate objective and
not be distracted by their irrelevant or annoying antics. Don�t expect much from
them in the way of support.

Have a talk with Harry about his
previous role and his current career goals. Describe how you see his role
changing, but find a way to provide him with leadership opportunities. Give him
feedback about his performance as a leader and try to help him succeed. I am
almost certain that, had I done this with Harry, he would have become an ally.

try the direct, problem-solving approach. With a
rational person, this will usually work if you handle the conversation correctly.
You must be sincere in your desire to improve the relationship and nondefensive in your communication. 


Bill, do you want to look good or do you
want to make a difference?


If games in organizational life are so damaging, then why
do they persist? Because they work. In the short term, people,
teams, and organizations get what they want through games.
However, in the long run, the cumulative effect of games can be
devastating. Reducing games is directly proportional to improving organizational climate and increasing organization results.
A leader who reduces his or her games becomes more authentic.
A team that reduces games becomes more trusting and connected. An organization that reduces games becomes more
believable, meaningful, attractive, creative, and productive.

Fear is the fuel of games.  Games are short cuts  to attempt
to get what we want. 

Having the courage to express the right thing, 
the character to do the right thing, 
and the constants (values/principles) to know the right thing 
are the prerequisites to go from gamesmanship to true leadership

Engaging in games means our emotional intelligence is
low
Emotional Intelligence reduces game playing and increases
authentic human interaction. games must be signifi cantly reduced to create
organizations that are healthy organisms

 Imagine an organization
with its energy fully harnessed onto leadership contribution,
not diffused and distracted with gamesmanship. Imagine an
organization focused on purpose, passionate about service,
connected in relationship, and producing sustainable results. 

 It is in our
nature as human beings to play games when we are in groups,
when stress and anxiety exist, and when �prizes� (promotions,
the boss�s favor, funding for a project, winning a contract,
and so on) are to be won and lost. 

They
inspired and promoted open, productive, and creative behaviors in their people. 

if leaders aren�t aware of the impact of
games and fail to take action against them, their organizations are bound to suffer the consequences.

Smashing rackets is STUPID and EXPENSIVE.

Cussing up a storm is STUPID and EMBARRASSING.

Punching the fence, your racket or something else is STUPID and will probably HURT.

Through a better understanding of
games, you can improve the ability of your organization to
reach its objectives, satisfy customers, and win in the marketplace, and, at the same time, contribute to making the working life of the people in your organization more fulfilling.

The more you know, the better
able you�ll be to limit their damage and turn the energy of
your people in more productive directions.

Harold created a tremendously
antagonistic environment within his department, setting
people against each other and focusing their energy on
 conflict rather than work objectives.

===============
 you pretend you want
the input of others but are actually pursuing your own
agenda. Harold suggested that he wanted to hold the
meeting for the good of his team and for his own selfimprovement, but in reality his goal was to identify
people who were criticizing him, and he ignored the
feedback.

Harold obviously used the
meeting to figure out who was behind the negative
responses
=============================

Harold may not have been playing these games on a conscious level; he may have initially
wanted to use the meeting to become a better manager. In
Harold�s mind, he may have rationalized that he was simply
protecting himself and his team from negative influences,
but in reality, he was playing his favorite games. 
 

 When you

 company�s culture favors transparency, intellectual honesty, teamwork, and open debate, the prevalence
of game playing is usually rather low.


 In contrast, fear-based,
strongly hierarchical cultures, for example, tend to encourage
game playing�people see game playing as the way to climb
the organizational ladder, and fear that if they don�t play,
they�ll be �losers.� In these cultures, games become a way of
managing the uncertainty and dependency that comes from
being down the hierarchical chain.


Similarly, extreme short-term pressure and environments
where disruptive change is taking place also tend to encourage games. In these situations, people use games to relieve
the pressure as well as to deal with change; games provide
an alternative method to deal with new people, policies, and
processes

 In Gotcha, people act as if they receive points for identifying and communicating others� mistakes. This game is
more likely to occur in companies that foster individual rather than collective recognition and that promote internal competition among employees to increase productivity. 

Mistakes are seen as an opportunity to criticize others and
put them down, and thus people hide mistakes rather than
use them as learning opportunities. Also, any criticism
will be seen as an attack, rather than as an opportunity for
improvement.

 No Bad News 
 hiding poor results from a boss to
avoid his wrath

Steve found that as they moved to a matrix-like
structure, a number of tension points arose between himself,
his direct reports, and his colleagues in other functions. To
diminish this tension, Steve played the Gray Zone game. He
took advantage of the new, looser reporting and decisionmaking structure to avoid making clear choices about who was responsible for what project. He would frequently tell his
team, �We�re all responsible for getting this done,� without
ever making anyone accountable for a project�s completion.
In this way, Steve didn�t step on anyone�s toes, and no one
felt slighted or ignored. Of course, relatively little was accomplished in the area for which Steve was responsible

 �My way,� she said, �I stay in management�s good
graces and make sure my department is properly funded.� 

The person who is on the game-conscious end of the continuum is unusually transparent and authentic. What you
see is what you get. Rarely does this individual have hidden
agendas. She possesses a genuine quality that invites trust
and open communication. When she wants direct reports to
work harder or better, she doesn�t resort to the manipulative
actions that are part and parcel of all games. Instead, she
attempts to rally them around a worthy cause or objective, 
using her passion and commitment to encourage others to
excel. She is not averse to asking for help when she needs it
or admitting her own fears and doubts when she has them


As soon as she becomes aware of what she�s doing,
she�ll disengage or at least try to manage this behavior. She
takes pride in choosing how to behave in a given situation
rather than being controlled by the game routine

great leaders combine �humility and
fierce resolve.� 

Their humility prevents them from resorting to games to fl ex their position power muscle or achieve
personal goals at the expense of organizational ones. At the
same time, they achieve great things through inspiration and
perspiration rather than manipulation. 

You may notice that your people aren�t
bringing the same enthusiasm and energy to tasks that they
once did. You may suspect that the �wrong� people are being
hired and promoted. You may fi nd that a key direct report
resigns unexpectedly. 

 story of one team that played
Gotcha too long, too hard, and with disappointing results. 


 Tim�s company had
a reputation for a high-risk, high-reward culture; people
who performed superlatively were handsomely compensated, whereas those who delivered average or even slightly
above-average results usually departed relatively quickly. A
great deal of internal competition existed for top jobs, and
the company attracted highly competitive individuals who
 enjoyed the inf ghting for resources and promotions. 

Team members did
their work by the numbers, keeping a low profi le and never suggesting any fresh ideas that might expose them to criticism. 

Tim was aware that the team had lost its momentum, that
they were dragging their feet in terms of coming up with a recommendation, and that their ideas weren�t particularly innovative.


In this environment, it is diffi cult to learn and grow.
Open and honest dialogue is a key to learning. 

 When things went wrong, they were quick to blame
people (not enough talent), structures (need to reorganize),
and strategy (have to go in a new direction).

allowing the right decision to be made based on the data and
analysis


No one is sure of the
right thing to do, and short deadlines and massive
amounts of paperwork add to the uncertainty. 

 Managers have to hire, deploy, motivate, and move people
within the organization, and in the process of leading people, 

"He must identify himself with the dreams, activities and sufferings of the people.
His life must be a continual sacrifice of self in the immediate service of his fellow men. He must be a
monk, striving to be a saint, willing to be a martyr, a revolutionary, a moral educator who
can bring about a new consciousness and awareness among the people." - is this service? Is this leadership?

The true leader,shows his capacity to assume heavy burdens of responsibility by taking upon himself the errors and failings of those weaker than he is. Corporate world is different.They take credit for the most trivial successes but seldom take responsibility when things go wrong. They blame the results of their own shortsightedness on some other convenient factor, but never on their own flawed strategy.
