But some people know exactly how to be difficult. They're the people who bring
you down with their negativity, criticism or anger. They refuse to cooperate.
They're irritating, frustrating and often infuriating. And if you respond to
someone else's difficult behaviour with anger and blame, withdrawal or
compliance, you may end up feeling guilty, stressed or depressed.

traditional description was not true.� A twelve-hundred-year-old teaching
was being contradicted by his own systematic observations!

The Story of Mandana Misra Vs. Shri Adi Shankara:
This debate throws light on the healthy competition that existed in India among followers of different philosophies. Essentially they were travelling towards the same unknown destination, yet they had the open mind and immense courage to test their faith, to question their beliefs, and to change their philosophies, if reason demanded the change. Similar to how different paths could still take one to the top of the same mountain, so too do all philosophies lead to the same goal of self realization. However, even though staunch belief in one�s path is necessary to make spiritual progress, when one meets obstacles, one should remain accepting towards new concepts, experiments, or questionings because these can potentially unlock some deep doors in our mind.

One is that we are rational egoists: Each person watches out only for his
or her own good, but sees rationally that only by being nice to others is it
possible to get what he or she wants. 

many people think that things work
smoothly only because each of us is smart enough to see that our own good
depends on treating others well.


selfish & compassionate

 we have taken care of our own basic needs, then there is time
left over to be loving and compassionate of others.


that were compassionate and
selfish� say that we are basically compassionate, loving creatures, but if there
is scarcity of resources such as food, clothing, and shelter, then compassion
will drop out and our selfish side will emerge.

Social interaction involves
opportunities for being treated well or being treated badly. Each of these
emotions arises in response to social situations. For example, I become fearful if a person is threatening to harm me. I feel love when someone has
treated me well, possibly in response to my treating him or her well.

would bring you happiness. You might have to give up your life.

Temperament is a certain emotional style, like being a shy or a moody
person� it�s a trait. Anger is an emotion; a person with an irritable temperament is constantly prone to being angry. Plato argued that the emotions,
temperament, and appetites for sex or food are all causes of trouble, and
human reason needs to take control.
 there
was a set of virtues�including courage, friendship, and compassion�that
should be in a harmonious relation inside each person. 


there is a time when it is appropriate to show anger, but
you need to express just the right amount of anger in just the right way, to
the right person at the right time. It�s no easy task

says that if you have to sacrifice one person to save the lives of a hundred people, you ought to do that. A Kantian will
put a restriction on that and say that even if a hundred people will die as a result of your decision, you ought never to violate the principle of not killing.

Being out of a life-threatening situation finally� to me it really
felt like a tremendous sense of celebration. It was truly like a gift. A gift of
life... of caring.

With a destructive emotion, there will always be a gap between the
way things appear and the ways things are.

Excessive attachment� desire, for instance�will not let us see a balance between the pleasant and unpleasant, constructive and destructive,
qualities in something or someone, and causes us to see it for a while as being
one hundred percent attractive� and therefore makes us want it. Aversion
will blind us to some positive qualities of the object, making us one hundred
percent negative toward that object, wishing to repel, destroy, or run away
from it.

�Such emotional states impair ones judgment, the ability to make a
correct assessment of the nature of things. 

permanent or impermanent, as having intrinsic properties or not. 

Thus, obscuring emotions impair one�s freedom by chaining thoughts
in a way that compels us to think, speak, and act in a biased way. By contrast,
constructive emotions go with a more correct appreciation of the nature of
what one is perceiving� they are grounded on sound reasoning.

the harm in terms of happiness or suffering�that our
thoughts and actions do to ourselves or to others.

one cannot
feel, at the very same moment, both love and hatred toward the same person
or the same object.

When one speaks of hating oneself, hate is not really at the core of the feeling. You might be upset with yourself, but this could be a form of pride, a sense of frustration arising from the
realization that you don�t live up to your expectations. But you can�t truly
hate yourself

 hatred, desire,confusion, pride, and jealousy.

�Hatred is the deeply felt wish to harm someone else, to destroy their
happiness. It is not necessarily expressed in a burst of anger. It�s not expressed
all the time, but it will manifest when meeting with circumstances that trigger ones animosity. It is also connected with many other related emotions,
such as resentment, bearing grudges, contempt, animosity, and so on.

�Then the opposite is attachment, which also has many aspects. There is
the plain desire for sensual pleasures or for an object we want to possess. But
there is also the subtle aspect of attachment to the notion o f�I,� to the person,
and to the solid reality of phenomena. Essentially, attachment has to do with
a kind of grasping that makes you see things in a way that they are not. It will
make you think, for instance, that things are permanent� that friendship,
human beings, love, possessions, will last�although it is clear that they will
not. So attachment means clinging to one�s way of perceiving things.

�Then there is ignorance, the lack of discernment between what needs to
be accomplished or avoided in order to achieve happiness and avoid suffering. O f course, ignorance is not normally regarded as an emotion in Western
culture, but it is clearly a mental factor that prevents a lucid and true ascertaining of reality. It is thus a mental state that obscures ultimate wisdom or
knowledge. Therefore it is considered to be an afflictive aspect of mind.

�Pride, too, has many aspects: being proud of one�s achievements, feeling
superior to others or holding them in contempt, wrong assessments of ones
own qualities, or not recognizing others� good qualities. It often goes with
not recognizing one�s own defects.

�Jealousy can be seen as an inability to rejoice in others� happiness. One
is never jealous of someone�s suffering, but of their happiness and good qualities. From a Buddhist perspective, it is a negative emotion. If our goal is precisely to bring well-being to others, we should be happy if they find
happiness by themselves. Why should we be jealous? Part of our work is already done� there is that much less to do.�

the nature of gold itself.

When one genuinely looks at it, it suddenly loses its strength.

 it takes time. But what is encouraging is that if you progress to the best of your capacity, you can
definitely check that it works.


leaders
=========
Given that people in the grip of rage readily make flawed decisions and
act out impulses they later regret, the answer is more than academic. 

 

 He observed that anger in a leader can take
on a special amplifying power among those led, simply because people pay so
much attention to what they say and do� and so skilled leaders have learned
to carefully calibrate how they display their dismay and anger. But beyond
that, leaders must know how to cool their own rage if they are to make the
best political decisions.


One way is by giving words to
what people are feeling, and so letting them know the leader understands.
But then the leader goes another step: absorbing their anger rather than letting it drive them to impulsive, destructive acts.


doubt is
very important for cultivating deeper insight and understanding. In
Buddhism, as in the scientific tradition, you must be skeptical, otherwise you
will not progress. 


�It all depends upon our motivation,� Matthieu Ricard suggested. �If
someone is walking toward a cliff, about to fall off, and is not listening to you
when you say, �Stop!� you might get angry and say, �Hey you, stupid, stop!�
Your motivation is completely altruistic. You are getting angry because quiet
ways have not been efficient in stopping that person in her course to harming
herself.�

transform anger into a mix of
compassion and patience 



do bad things� not
just disturb others, but even kill. You don�t care about manners or etiquette,
or that you are in a high position in society but use it for evil purposes.


 inconsiderate of
others. You have no fear of bad karma. You can also do bad things, but because you never consider the consequences.

utter irresponsibility, and a lack of concern about longterm consequences


Those actions that are committed
by people out of ignorance are considered to be less negative than where the
individual acts knowingly with full awareness of the consequences and severity of the action, which is considered morally reprehensible. Ignorance is
therefore often an excuse. For example, it is possible for a person just walking
along to kill ants without even seeing them. In that case, you engage in the
action of killing, and you do accumulate karma�but it is pretty lightweight.

Emotions could come and go in a matter of seconds or minutes, but a mood can last a whole day.
If we are furious again and again, we will then have a long period in which we are irritable.


When we re in a mood it biases and restricts how we think. It makes us vulnerable in ways that we are normally not. So the negative moods create a lot of problems for us, because they change how we think. If I wake up in an irritable mood, Fm looking for a chance to be angry.
Things that ordinarily would not frustrate me, do. The danger of a mood is not only that it biases thinking but that it increases emotions. When Im in an irritable mood, my anger comes stronger and faster, lasts longer, and is
harder to control than usual.

When we re in a -ve mood, it limits the way we think. It makes us vulnerable in ways that we don't usually do. So the negative moods create a lot of issues for us, and they're affecting the way we think. If I wake up with -ve messages or in an irritable mood, there is a higher chance that you will get angry. 
you get frustrated for normal things. 


It increases your emotions. When I'm in an irritable mood, my frustration is stronger and quicker, it's longer, and it's quicker. 
It's harder to manage than normal.


But if you cant achieve that goal, then the second goal is to not act on
the emotion, not let it adversely affect others. And if you cant achieve that
goal, then the last is to learn from it in the hope that you�ll do better the next
time. The first step is, I think, the real goal.

I was able to prevent myself from acting and saying anything I would regret. 


lying, once someone has crossed that barrier, then it is
progressively easier to cross the line again and again. The key to preventing
cruelty, then, lies in finding ways to prevent that first act.
