Hope you all agree that there is no progress in the last quater and we are here to discuss how to prevent that from happening.

for this we have to improve the demo-to-close conversion rates, and shorten the sales cycle.

investors are evaluating us based on these metrics and it is hightime to address.

I've the responsibility to change the investorsï¿½ opinions but for that I need to understand more about our sales calls & demo process and whether the situation can be corrected or improved.

Let me putforth the problems one by one and I want the sales team to give huge clarity.

1. I'm actually sitting with the presales team to increase the leads but Without increasing the number of leads & by improving the internal working methodology, can the output be achieved?

2. Are we immediately jumping into the demo without lead qualification.
Whether lead qualification doc. completely filled.
We need to take it into account, the customer business situation as well during this covid hrs. 

3. I've seen appreciation from sales team to Hina & Abdul. Do you receive it from the client too? Where do we save these data.

4. Are you losing it to competitors. Do you sales guys discuss & come with strategies

5. How To Increase Revenue - Do More, Faster.if there are more activities per sales rep, whether the funnel will be filled, do we end up with more revenue.

5. Like this team, other team hv issues that will be resolved shortly. Do not blame CRM,Product,Back office Support.
