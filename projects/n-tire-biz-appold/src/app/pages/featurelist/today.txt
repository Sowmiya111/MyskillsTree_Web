I know a SaaS CEO who plans on raising his Series C round later this year.
demo-to-close conversion rates began slipping, and the sales cycle became painfully long.

 he can show investors a higher demo-to-close conversion rate and leaner sales cycle.


This was a huge problem because his future investors were going to evaluate his company based on those metrics. If he didn�t get his conversion rates up and shorten his sales cycle, it would mean the difference between an $80 million valuation and a $130 million valuation upon closing the round (or worse, it could result in failing to raise the funds entirely).

 He didn�t need more opportunities; that wouldn�t change his investors� opinions of his subpar conversion rates and long sales cycle. He needed to understand what his team was doing and saying on their calls and demos to cause this situation so it could be corrected.


reps would almost immediately jump into the demo. So his first task was to create a 1st call sales deck so they could build more context before showing the product.

Todd was an extremely bright, capable executive with a
clear and inspired vision for his organization. He had a true passion for his work
and a great desire to do good things in the world. The problem, however, was
that he had gotten completely sidetracked by his intense animosity toward his
boss, embarking on an obsessive quest to get this man fired. As outside
observers, my colleague and I could readily see that, if this war continued, the
inevitable outcome would be Todd�s own termination. Todd, however, could not
see this at all.
So, as we ate our sandwiches, the two of us tried to help Todd
view the situation more clearly. No luck. Todd spent the entire lunch ranting
about his boss�s failings and the general unfairness of his circumstances. As we
predicted, Todd was soon looking for another job. Many people experience
difficulties at work because they do not accurately �read� their environment or
correctly anticipate the consequences of their actions. 

Work is truly a critical component of happiness. Unlike the other creatures on
the planet, people need to have a purpose.Meaningful work
may be paid or unpaid, inside or outside the home�but for many of us, our
sense of purpose is connected to our jobs. Unfortunately, if people lack clear
goals, have unpleasant working relationships, or simply don�t understand how
organizations operate, the joy of accomplishment is often replaced by frustration
and disappointment.

� A confused and anxious employee who is not sure exactly what is
expected by management
� A tired and angry person who is clearly in the wrong job
� A frustrated manager who does not know how to deal with a poorly
performing employee
� People at all levels who feel that their boss is incompetent, unfair, or
unreasonable
� Colleagues who have constant disagreements because of drastically
different work styles
� Entire departments at war with each other because of conflicting roles
� Many, many people who feel that they are somehow being treated
unfairly


we are building relationships,
developing strategies, and opening communication
channels.

To succeed, we not only have to do outstanding work, but we also have to
deal with quirky bosses and annoying co-workers. Colleagues get defensive
when we point out their mistakes, unscrupulous rivals try to stab us in the back,
and managers make decisions that seem totally unfair�or completely idiotic.

Wishes put the focus on what we want �them� to do. Goals highlight what we
can do ourselves. Wishes take us out of the power position by implying that we
are at the mercy of others. Goals give us power by describing results that we
intend to accomplish.convert wishes to Goals.


Goals imply action. Wishes imply sitting around and waiting for something to
happen.

Martyrs:Martyrs usually have the interests of the organization at heart, their approach to
advocacy often torpedoes their own career. When these Martyrs jump on their
soapbox, their adamant and single-minded preaching tends to make people run
the other way; 


Winners are people whose behavior at work contributes to both business and
personal success. I believe that these are the folks who succeed at office politics,
especially in the long run. Glenn was a Winner. He joined his company as an
accountant, but knew that he wanted to do more. As his career progressed, he
learned about other areas of finance, took on several highly visible projects,
delivered results in the face of difficult obstacles, got to know company
executives, and developed many positive working relationships. Glenn became
known as a pleasant, helpful person who always did an outstanding job.
Eventually, he moved through several management positions to become vice
president of finance for the largest division in his company. At each step, he
tried to improve operations and help his staff develop new skills and abilities.
Some people may have envied Glenn�s success, but almost everyone agreed that
it was well-deserved


Their political power is
automatically limited by their excessive behavior, which gradually alienates
everyone around them. Although most of us are not so extreme, we all act out of
bitterness, selfishness, or uncontrolled emotion from time to time.


Never advance your own interests by harming the business or
hurting other people.

Big goals often seem
much more manageable if you simply focus on the next
specific action that you need to take.

 Upon entering a room of complete strangers,
they can quickly determine who actually has power and who is just faking it.
They get along with even the most prickly people and can bring up controversial
issues without provoking or offending anyone. When others play destructive
political games, they are able to respond with subtle countermoves; and if they
set their sights on a goal, they almost always get what they�re after. In short,
Winners are blessed with Political Intelligence.

� Clearly define the steps that will lead to your goals 
� Recognize the power relationships in any group 
� Capitalize on opportunities to increase your personal power and influence 
� Identify the true motives and hidden agendas of others 
� Remain focused on important objectives and ignore distractions 
� Build positive relationships, even with unpleasant people 
� Respond appropriately to both devious and direct attacks 
� Turn conflicts and arguments into productive discussions 
� Avoid wasting energy on irrelevant issues and unattainable goals


The Organizational Facts of Life
� OFOL #1: Organizations are not democracies.
� OFOL #2: Some people have more power than others.
� OFOL #3: Virtually all decisions are subjective.
� OFOL #4: Your boss has control over much of your life.
� OFOL #5: Fairness is an impossible goal.


The person with the most power wins.


Now, think beyond your own reactions. Would most of your
co-workers list the same problems with your boss? If so, do
any of them seem to cope with this difficult person better than
you do? But if not, why do you have a harder time with this
manager than others do? Have you had difficulty with other
bosses in the past? Or do the two of you just have very
different work styles?
Moving from assessment to action:
� You probably can�t change your boss, so you need to figure
out what you can do to manage this relationship more
intelligently: (1) List the situations in which you find your
manager�s behavior to be most frustrating or annoying. (2)
For each situation, list the way that you usually react. How
might your behavior make the situation worse? How would
your boss describe your behavior? (3) Identify a more
productive reaction to these situations. If other people have an
easier time with your boss, use them as role models. Set goals
for changing your behavior with your boss.


I am not as effective as I would like to be in influencing others.
I frequently find myself in arguments and disagreements with
people at work.
I feel that I have often been treated unfairly in work situations.
There are certain people that I find it impossible to work with.
When I am with a new group, I find it hard to tell where the
real power lies.
I am often uncertain about the true motives of other people.
I find it hard to work with people that I don�t particularly like.
I often feel that I am being taken advantage of at work.
If I feel that I am being attacked or undermined by others, I am
not sure how to respond.





I find that I am easily distracted from important goals by less
important tasks.
I get easily upset about matters that are trivial or not relevant
to my goals.
Certain situations at work may prevent me from accomplishing
goals that matter to me.
Management doesn�t recognize the true value of the work that
I do.


Those who try to control others through abusive
power and authority usually fail in the long run�or someone stabs them in the
back at the first opportunity.

�This is where we learn,� says
Dilbert, �that you are my co-worker, not my boss.�

The
moral of this story is that being the boss doesn�t necessarily mean that
you have the most leverage.


Loyalty is
always part of the Leverage Equation. Whether or not people repeat
your negative remarks usually depends upon where their loyalty lies.

When
pilots at a major airline received significant wage increases after threatening to
strike, flight attendants decided to follow their example. They went on strike and
refused to return to work�but instead of getting raises, the flight attendants got
pink slips. Lower-paid workers were hired to fill their positions. These
unfortunate employees lost their jobs because they failed to realize that flight
attendants simply don�t have the same leverage as pilots. Why? Because new
flight attendants can be hired and trained much more quickly.


 In another
interesting airline example, executives at a major carrier that was teetering on the
brink of bankruptcy decided to award themselves huge bonuses right after asking
their unions for large pay concessions. The resulting furor caused the CEO to
rescind the bonuses and publicly apologize. But that wasn�t enough to appease
irate employees and, shortly thereafter, the CEO resigned. This otherwise
intelligent man had obviously underestimated (or overlooked) the leverage of the
unions during a financial crisis


Controlling parents who fail to recognize this change will have a tough time
when their kids grow up. Leverage can also shift in romantic relationships. If
one partner begins to lose interest, the other automatically loses leverage.
Misguided attempts to regain leverage by clinging and begging will just make
the abandoned partner look weak and pathetic, reducing the poor soul�s leverage
even further.

Getting a new boss can trigger a leverage
earthquake�and create a great deal of stress. When a new manager comes in
from the outside, having no prior history with the group, all bets are off.
Everyone starts from zero and must prove themselves all over again. I witnessed
one such dramatic shift when a new vice president assumed control of an
information systems department. Under the previous VP, the systems director
had been the shining star, while the operations director had received a letter of
reprimand. But after a few months under the new boss, the operations director
was given more responsibility and the systems director was laid off�a complete
leverage flip-flop.


Never intentionally offend anyone at work.
you should learn to work
with people that you don�t particularly like and handle conflicts in a constructive
adult manner. Back in my corporate days, I had a boss who should have learned
this lesson. Jonathan, the vice president of my department, was constantly at
odds with Sam, one of the division general managers. He played power games
with Sam, refusing to share information or involve him in decisions. Imagine
Jonathan�s surprise when Sam was made president of the company, thereby
becoming his boss.

Low-leverage people spend a lot of time thinking, talking, or complaining
about unfair treatment, unfair policies, or unfair management. 

�boomerang people��my term for those chronically unhappy employees who
predictably came back with new problems on a regular basis. Every couple of
months, Alvin would storm into my office complaining about his boss, his coworkers, his work assignments, company policies, company benefits, or some
other issue.. One of Alvin�s
complaints was that, although he did good work, he never got promoted. The sad
truth was that he actually was a bright, creative person whose work was indeed
quite acceptable�but his constant complaining about �fairness� issues made
people try to avoid him. When no one wants to work with you, your
opportunities for advancement are definitely limited.

High-leverage people don�t obsess about fairness. Instead, they remain
focused on actions that will move them toward their goals.

During her first two years on the job, Vivian received frequent recognition for
her efforts to turn around a failing department and modernize corporate
accounting practices. Then she got a double dose of bad news: First, the manager
who had been her mentor left the company, and Vivian began reporting to a new
boss whose last-minute changes drove her crazy. Next, the HR manager
informed her that her own leadership style had generated a number of complaints
from the accounting staff. Because Vivian was a fast-track achiever who had
never known anything but success, this was a real blow. She spent one long,
depressed weekend lying around the house, obsessively going over the things her
staff had said, and wondering if she should just look for another job. But by
Monday morning, she had made up her mind to take charge and correct the
situation. She met with the staff to discuss their concerns, formulated a strategy
to address the issues, and discussed her plan with the HR manager. She also took
the initiative to sit down with her new boss and clarify the way that they
communicated about changes. As the situation improved over the next few
months, Vivian�s credibility as a manager actually increased, because she had
proven that she could handle a difficult situation in a positive manner.


Kim Su was a talented information technology specialist
who liked tackling new challenges. When people from various parts of the
company asked for help with computer problems, she always responded eagerly.
Unfortunately, serving other departments was not actually part of her job, so
these outside requests often kept Kim Su from meeting deadlines on her own
projects. Even though this problem was repeatedly pointed out by her supervisor,
Kim Su continued to do the outside work that she enjoyed. When one of her
colleagues was promoted to senior IT specialist, Kim Su was upset and
complained that she should have been promoted as well. If promotion was her
goal, however, she needed to make wiser decisions about where she focused her
energy.
Low-leverage people tend to waste a lot of energy on complaining, worrying,
blaming, gossiping, scheming, and whining. High-leverage people focus their
energy on producing results and building relationships. They concentrate on
positive goals and things they can control.

When an
employee survey revealed that his staff had a poor opinion of his leadership
skills, Chuck called the employees together, berated them for disloyalty, and told
them that he�d be watching them carefully in the future. Word of this tonguelashing spread quickly through the organization, eventually reaching the
president, who was not at all pleased. By allowing anger to drive his response,
Chuck succeeded in simultaneously reducing his leverage with both upper
management and his employees, demonstrating a remarkable degree of political
stupidity.
