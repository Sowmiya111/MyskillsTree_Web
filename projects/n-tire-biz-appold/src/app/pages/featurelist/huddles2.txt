 leadership
maturity means considering others before yourself.

When leaders learn and live good values, they make themselves more valuable and lift
the value of other people


 All of us are a
bundle of both great strengths and great weaknesses and humility is being able to
be honest about both



Humble leaders are comfortable with who they are and feel no need to draw
attention to themselves. They revel in the accomplishments of others, empower
others to excel, and allow others to shine

It just means having the right perspective.
 good leaders can motivate others
and be humble at the same time.

it�s also because
people sense my desire to add value to them and those who are hungry to learn
often seek me out.

 As people share their issues and concerns with vulnerability, I try
to share my experiences with transparency

I found her to be delightful and insightful. With each
question I was able to open more doors of understanding into her experiences.
By the end of our time I had found a wonderful friend. I learned a great deal, and
I believe the rest of the audience did too

�Leaders, what am I required to do that no one else can do
except me?
I
knew I would not be able to fill his shoes or the search committee�s expectations.


I
did that because I knew that adding value to people with high potential who are
hungry to grow is one of the best investments a leader can make.

I have always handpicked the people I invest in

Today Matters and Sometimes You Win�Sometimes You Learn.

I am able to add value to you

make
ourselves look smart by giving clever answers

Ideas have a short shelf life. You must act on them before the expiration date.

no idea will fly if the influencers don�t embrace
it. After all, they are the people who carry thoughts from idea to
implementation



Beautiful lines from Built to Last - Jim Collins
A visionary company is like a great work of art. Think of Michelangelo�s scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or his statue of David. Think of a great and enduring novel like Huckleberry Finn or Crime and Punishment. Think of Beethoven�s Ninth Symphony or Shakespeare�s Henry V. Think of a beautifully designed building, like the masterpieces of Frank Lloyd Wright or Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. You can�t point to any one single item that makes the whole thing work; it�s the entire work�all the pieces working together to create an overall effect�that leads to enduring greatness.
