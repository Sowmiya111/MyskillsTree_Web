So what you�re saying is
Here
is what I am understanding about your idea.


no documentation
doubts
 no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners style
 more listening and questioning 

openness to her meetings
team members need to speak more openly & honestly
new ideas

some employees respond better to a firmer, more decisive leader
others flourish when they are given latitude for autonomy and participation

Employees really get something from good, tight coaching 

everyone had a stake in the results.


Courage on the part of the leaders is also missing, the courage
and know-how that give the leader the ability to tell the truth
in a way that helps others succeed. And this is a two-way street.
Employees aren�t getting feedback about their performance,
but neither are leaders getting the feedback that they need. 

real commitment - the kind where people take the
extra step. -  measure it


What exactly do you need, and what exactly
have you been getting?

coach, motivate, and mentor

I really need some clean wins. 

What I need from you is . . . � or, �What I think of your performance is . . .

have your ideas ready too, so that together you are helping to solve the issues

When will I follow up? What are the next steps?

Serious tennis enthusiasts are out there to play, to get exercise,
and to get the satisfaction of a game well played. Winning or
losing may not be the ultimate goal, but who doesn�t walk off
the court with a spring in their step after winning a round?
Who doesn�t vow to do just a little better, work just a little
harder next time, after they lose?
Without the feedback needed to know good shots from bad,
in from out, we will never feel a sense of accomplishment and
will simply be operating in the dark. 

We don�t let them know how to win

top performers with low (or no) expectations

We need feedback to make work meaningful, to
feel accomplishment 

Employees need to have a level of trust in the leader�to
feel that the leader has their best interests at heart


an eye for results

ideas
thoughts
observations
point of view
inputs

persistence in purpose,
an efficiency in execution, 
and the ability to communicate high standards

�FeedForward.� The
idea is not to look back in order to judge past deeds, but instead
to focus on the future and on what can be done to correct,
encourage, or improve performance in the days, weeks, and
months ahead.

have lost control of their wills, in confrontation of the overwhelming charisma of
the hypnotist.

his audiences were both fascinated and amused

hypnosis was not
dependent on any exceptional quality on the part of the hypnotist, but rather the
subconscious approval of the subject to undergo the process


extraordinary charisma

Every day, in every way, I�m getting better and better

Every strong structure needs a strong
foundation.

people don�t fail because they�re not good at their jobs. People
fail because they don�t know how to succeed

�I watched two new IT engineers slowly
lose all motivation, not long after they were hired. They
simply got no signal from their manager on what they were
doing right, let alone any corrective information on how to
improve. They told me that they just came to the conclusion
that no one really cared. They figured the company was really
just paying for someone to show up to work and meeting goals
was �not that important.� They were [already] looking around
for something better

Think of the lost opportunities for feedback 

employees were experiencing (not to mention the HR
manager). All three knew what the problem was, but no one
wanted to address it. Or, perhaps, none of them knew how to
address it. 

More specifically, I wonder what �better� looked like to
these employees. 

highly intelligent, highly capable people

rate - split up

People generally don�t know how to deliver feedback well�
or, for that matter, how to take it well.


Feedback typically
creates stress for the leader who is not comfortable with giving
it and fear in the employee who doesn�t handle feedback
well. 


Often employees devolve
rather than evolve; they gradually slip into a way of doing things more slowly or less effectively because they
are allowed to by (you guessed it) lack of specific feedback. Now the employee has no excuse; the deliverable
is clear, specific, and expected.
