When we are threatened or in danger, however, our autonomic nervous system
shuts down the activity of the ventral branch of the vagus nerve and regresses to
an earlier, more primitive evolutionary response of either spinal sympathetic
activity (flight/fight) or depressive behavior (withdrawal).
If we have a well-functioning nervous system and are socially engaged, we
might naturally meet a new situation with openness, trust, and positive
expectations. We feel safe, and might first try to communicate, cooperate, and
share. Even in the face of a threat, our behavior might still be open and friendly
at first. Sometimes this positive, prosocial behavior can also make the other
person feel safe, which in turn might be enough to defuse a potentially
threatening situation.

If our autonomic nervous system feels that a situation is unsafe, our response
can shift down one phylum, from social engagement to the level of reptiles with
a strong spinal sympathetic chain response, and we might fight to overcome the
threat, or flee to avoid it. If the situation is so extreme that fighting or fleeing is
not enough, we may shift down even further and shut down or collapse into a

The dorsal vagus, acting on its own, brings
about a state of metabolic shutdown. This can be described as
�immobilization with fear�: we are afraid, but we do nothing to confront the
danger or run away; we just give up

If a hawk is cir-cling in a field over a
mouse, the hawk will see any mouse that tries to run away and will swoop down
and catch it in its sharp claws. So, instead of employing the defense strategy of
fleeing, the mouse freezes. It slows down its vital activity and holds its breath
until the hawk has flown away and the danger is over.
if the slowdown is too sudden or too extreme, it can result in the
mouse being literally scared to death. About 10 percent of mice die from
shutting down as a response to danger from a bird of prey or a snake.

People with a diagnosis of depression, or people in a depressed state, typically
lose interest in activities that once were pleasurable. They over-eat, experience
loss of appetite, or have digestive problems. They have reduced energy, and they
become inactive, introverted, apathetic, helpless, and asocial. They can feel sad,
anxious, empty, hopeless, worthless, guilty, irritable, ashamed, or restless. They
may experience lethargy, lack of energy, and a lack of goal-oriented activity.
They can have problems concentrating, remembering details, or mak-ing
decisions, and are often plagued by the aches and pains of fibromyalgia. They
may contemplate, attempt, or commit suicide. These can all be symptoms of
activity in the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve.
