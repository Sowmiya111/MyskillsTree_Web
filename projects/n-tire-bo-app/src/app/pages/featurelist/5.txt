Got 2 Mac books bought for ios people. One was given to the developer and the other was free.Anu asked Sundar and he gave.Others including me having lower level configurations - I was not there and both Sundar & Anu never told.I came to know when the other ios person joined.I just approved to buy another mac and never even asked about this.I give complete freedom to Sundar. 
But we bought 2 laptops to Anand & Vijoy.Asked them to choose between HP & the other unknown brand. Anand picked the unknown brand - I was there.Given full freedom to the employee.

IT amount are paid to Murali by the Company.Initial yrs, he said, he didn't hv money and will repay. It never happened and I think, he is still getting the benefits - to ask or not ask is a delicate position. If asked, he will definitely retaliate.
So, if Anu asks the same, are we going to give IT benefits to her.
